# Result Types in TypeScript

![Result Types Presentation Cover](/slides-export/1.png)

## About This Presentation

This presentation explores the `Result` type pattern in TypeScript and how it can transform error handling in your applications. The `Result` type helps handle success and error cases without relying on traditional `try/catch` blocks, making the data flow more predictable and encouraging developers to think about both happy and unhappy paths up front.

### Key Topics Covered

- What is a Result Type and why should you use it
- Similar patterns in other languages (Rust, Go, Haskell)
- Comparison with traditional error handling approaches
- Implementation patterns in TypeScript
- Integration with the Effect library
- Real-world examples and use cases
